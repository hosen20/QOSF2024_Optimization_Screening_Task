# Different approaches for solving BPP

It is highly suggested to follow this path when checking this repository:
1. Read the READme.md file
2. Read the pdf file
3. Check the optimization.ipynb notebook
4. Check the other .py files

BPP (bin packing problem) is solved in this repository using 4 different approaches:
1. VQE
2. QAOA
3. Dwave ExactSolver
4. Dwave Qbsolv

The repository has the following structure:
1. Problem.py file: this file contains a class used to prepare the QUBO model/equations.
2. Experiment.py file: this file contains a class used to run the different approaches.
3. optimization.ipynb notebook: this notebook shows the previous file in use with the results.
